# Dancing Puppet

[See the project in action](https://geli25.github.io/final_project/)

**The live version does not include FaceOSC due to permission issues**

Created via P5.js and Matter.js, this is a puppet that the user can interact with and manipulate. The head will respond to the background music by changing colors and size. In the original version, the head's position is corresponds to the user's head position, tracked via FaceOSC. This is not in the github version for convenience.


I want this piece to represent the current state of the collective dream amongst the Post-Humanist world to become one with technology. Even though our head is fully involved in dreaming of such a state, our body is still limited by various physical and technical boundaries that do not allow us to do so. Our head is not one with our body, and even though we may have a body, it is like a puppet in the eyes of technology.
